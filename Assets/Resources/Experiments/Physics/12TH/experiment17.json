        "Move the contact point of the potential divider to apply some reverse bias voltage (Vr). For low reverse bias, the current is negligibly small i.e., of the order of 10–8 A to 10–10 A and hence with milliammeter or microammeter, you will observe zero reading.",
        "Slowly increase the voltage across the Zener diode in steps and record the value of reverse bias voltage Vr and also record the corresponding reverse current Ir from the reading of the microammeter. Take care that the reverse voltage Vr is increased in steps of 0.1 V."
