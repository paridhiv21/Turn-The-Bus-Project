        "Connect the circuit as shown in Fig. E 18.3. (Note that the baseemitter junction is forward biased and the collector-base junction is reverse biased. For example, in an n-p-n transistor; base is given a + ve voltage w.r.t. emitter. Also collector is given a high + ve voltage w.r.t. emitter.)",
        "To obtain the input characteristics of the transistor, keep the value of the collector-emitter voltage VCE fixed. First adjust VCE = 0 V and then vary the base-emitter voltage VBE in steps of 0.1 V and for each value of VBE note the base current IB.",
        "Repeat above step by keeping VCE fixed at three different values. You will observe that IB will continue to be zero for a number of observations i.e., till VBE = 0.6 to 0.7 V for silicon transistor and 0.2 to 0.3 V for germanium transistor. Thereafter, it will increase slowly and then rapidly, till IB is nearly 90per cent of maximum range of the microammeter.",
        "To obtain the output characteristics of transistor, keep the base current IB at 10 µA (say). Note the value of collector current IC keeping VCE = 0 V.",
        "Now increase the value of VCE very carefully in small steps. Note the corresponding values of IC. (At first the value of IC will increase very rapidly and then increase slowly to almost a constant value[Fig. E 18.4 (b)]. IB should be retained constant as noted earlier.",
        "Repeat above two steps for three different values of IB i.e., say 20 µA, 30 µA, 40 µA. You will observe that when IB increases IC also increases."
